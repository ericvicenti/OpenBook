# Protocol

This is on GitHub because this should be a collaborative process. If you have ideas, improvements, or comments, feel free to make issues and pull requests.

## Basics

### HTTP Consistencies

OpenBook builds upon the success and features of HTTP. For example, OpenBook supports encrypted and unencrypted access over ports 443 and 80, respectively. For initial https interactions, a typical SSL encryption chain is used.

OpenBook servers should send and respond to the following HTTP status codes:

* 200 - Success / Data
* 301 - Moved
* 302 - Forward
* 400 - Invalid Request
* 403 - Access not allowed
* 404 - Page not found
* 500 - Server Error

Forwards can happen across protocols. ie, if a host wants to demand HTTPS, they can forward from the HTTP to the HTTPS, which will trigger the typical SSL authenticaiton process. Forwards are also used for typical path manipulation within a host. Lastly, when a forward is made to another host, that host is should be authenticated normally.

OpenBook hosts need to support and supply only the following HTTP verbs:

* GET - For retrieving pages and authentication

* POST - For pageing response pages to a page

* PUT - Send feedback about the content on a page

### SSL Authentication

For most verbs and routes, hosts will demand encryption by redirecting to HTTPS. When a host connects to a peer, it will check its public key with its list of known hosts.


### Example

A host makes an initial request to another; `somebody.name` is trying to recieve content from another host, `username.friendbook.com`. `somebody.name` provides an HTTP header which identifies itself as `somebody.name`. Now `username.friendbook.com`, who does not recognize the public key being used by the requester, needs to verify that this server is the real authority for `somebody.name`.


`username.friendbook.com` requests a host identity check on `somebody.name`. It connects over HTTPS using typical SSL security chains to trust them up until this point. `somebody.name` responds with a public key, which is saved as a known host, and is matched up against the public key being used to connect.

At this point `username.friendbook.com` can trust that they are truly talking to `somebody.name`. Based on the trust involved in dns inheritance, friendbook can decide if `somebody.name` has access. Because he is just getting content, friendbook allows it.

## Methods

### GET Authentication

A host queries another host for it's basic information by making a HTTPS GET request to `https://HOST_NAME/_auth`

The auth response contains the following:

* "key": String

  The public SSL key that this host uses to authenticate with

### GET Page

A host provides an OpenBooks page a GET request. Hosts can serve traditional HTML sites alongside OpenBook pages, if it chooses.


A page is the name for a nugget of OpenBook content. They reside under any path under the host. For example, a blog page might be located at `http://first.last.name/blog/2012/hello_world`. A page can reside at _any valid url_ under the host. 

A page contains the following in a JSON object:

* "title": String

  The title of the page, limited to 140 characters, which should not contain links or anything other than Unicode text


* "body": String

  The URL where the content of the page can be found.


* "date": Integer

  A UNIX timestamp of the first pageing of this content


* "policy": String

  The organization's given name for the policy by which this page is governed.



### POST Page Link

A link to a page can be sent from one host to another. The host or provider then decides what to do with the submission. For example, `somebody.name` wants to page some content to her friend's page at `username.friendbook.com`. If friendbook trusts `somebody.name`, the content might instantly appear on the page. Friendbook might also only recognize and allow content from other recognized providers.

For some providers, the posting ability will be used as a feedback mechanism, to collect contextual responses to content. Other providers can build heirechal discussion boards with this ability.


### PUT Page Feedback

Feedback is a mechanism by which a server can tell another server that what it links to is good or bad. This might be recognized as a 'like', 'upvote', or 'downvote'. In any case, it is up to the host to respond to the feedback it recieves. Most benevolent providers will force the displaying of feedback, and some (like ones which model reddit) will use the feedback to order content and push other content off the page or onto other pages.
